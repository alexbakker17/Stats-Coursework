# Stats Coursework

This is a repo containing my submitted coursework for the third module of my Data Science Masters: Statistical Methods and Data Analysis

The brief containes the information I was given about the task and the marking criteria.

The data used was:
  1. The Ames Housing dataset (info can be found about it here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AmesHousing/index.html)
  2. A provided dataset called soccer (which is inside the data folder)
